## 📌 About This Project

ChronicRisk KE predicts the risk of **diabetes** and **hypertension** among Kenyan adults using the 2022 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS 2022). The system is designed as a decision support tool for community health workers (CHWs) — allowing them to screen patients at grassroots level and refer high-risk individuals for clinical testing.

This project was built as a Final Year capstone project in BSc Information Technology, motivated by a personal family experience with undetected chronic disease.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

A significant proportion of Kenyan adults living with hypertension or diabetes have never been diagnosed — because routine screening does not reach rural and low-income communities. CHWs need a practical, data-driven tool that works without laboratory equipment.
